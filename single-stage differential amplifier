# Specifications
loop_gain_db = 40  # dB
ugb_target = 80e6  # 80 MHz
cmrr_target_db = 81  # dB

# 1. Calculate Loop Gain (A)
loop_gain_linear = 10 ** (loop_gain_db / 20)  # Convert dB to linear scale
print(f"Loop Gain (Linear): A > {loop_gain_linear:.2f}")

# 2. Calculate Unity-Gain Bandwidth (UGB)
# Assuming loop gain (A) is the same as calculated above
# UGB = A * Bandwidth
A = loop_gain_linear  # Taking A as the calculated loop gain
bandwidth = ugb_target / A
print(f"Bandwidth for UGB of {ugb_target/1e6:.2f} MHz: {bandwidth/1e3:.2f} kHz")

# 3. Calculate CMRR
# Convert CMRR from dB to linear scale
cmrr_linear = 10 ** (cmrr_target_db / 20)  # CMRR in linear scale
# Using CMRR = Ad / Acm
A_d_A_cm = cmrr_linear
print(f"Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR): Ad / Acm ≈ {A_d_A_cm:.2f}")


\\ output 

Loop Gain (Linear): A > 100.00
Bandwidth for UGB of 80.00 MHz: 800.00 kHz
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR): Ad / Acm ≈ 11227.24
